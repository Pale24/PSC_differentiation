# Deep Learning for PSC differentiation

Applying deep learning for very early recognition of pluripotent stem cell differentiation


In this repo you will find the jupyter notebook of our recent paper on detecting very early signs of differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. 

The model was run on Keras2.0 with TensorFlow as backend. 

Images are available upon request. 

Work in progress...
